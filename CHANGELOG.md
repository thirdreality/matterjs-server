# Changelog for the OHF Matter(.js) Server

This page shows a detailed overview of the changes between versions without the need to look into code, especially to see relevant changes while interfaces and features are still in flux.

<!--
	Placeholder for the next version (at the beginning of the line):
	## **WORK IN PROGRESS**
-->

## **WORK IN PROGRESS**

- Feature: (ThirdReality) New `@matter-server/mqtt-bridge` package (matter2mqtt): publishes bridge status, device list, availability and OnOff state to an MQTT broker using a zigbee2mqtt-style topic layout, and routes `<device>/set` OnOff commands to the controller. Enabled via new CLI flags `--mqtt-url`, `--mqtt-prefix` and `--mqtt-client-id`; without `--mqtt-url` the server behaves as before

## 1.3.3 (2026-07-28)

- Enhancement: (pkese) Dashboard network graphs space nodes by signal quality (Thread LQI, Wi-Fi RSSI) instead of using one fixed edge length
- Fix: Update BLE library

## 1.3.2 (2026-07-28)

- Feature: (lboue) Dashboard cluster view shows a "Semantic Tags (TagList)" panel on the Descriptor cluster
- Enhancement: Thread nodes' neighbor and route tables are re-read a few minutes after startup and every 24h afterward; disabled together with the rest of the Thread diagnostics via `--disable-thread-diagnostics`
- Enhancement: Optimized the Dashboard "Update Connection Data" dialog for sleepy ICD LIT devices
- Enhancement: Optimized periodic node work (time synchronization, energy polling, Thread topology refresh) for sleepy ICD LIT devices
- Fix: Fixes and enhances the DST determination, and sends a second TimeZone entry when the host zone has an upcoming permanent offset change, plus a closing DST entry when the device has room for one
- Fix: A node reporting that it has no usable time is now resynced right away instead of being held off for up to a day, while reconnect-driven syncs keep their longer spacing
- Fix: Command responses and events now expose acronym field names in the Python Matter Server casing (e.g. `videoStreamID`, `groupID`, `PAKEPasscodeVerifier`), matching the generated Python client and Home Assistant; the previous lowercased-acronym keys are still emitted alongside for compatibility
- Fix: Update matter.js to 0.17.7
    - Fixes and Optimizations

## 1.3.1 (2026-07-23)

- Feature: (lboue) Dashboard cluster view shows an "Active Features" panel listing the cluster's supported features by name, decoded from the FeatureMap attribute
- Fix: (lboue) Dashboard now considers the audio/video features a Camera/Audio device advertises

    - Enhance workarounds in commissioning for devices that drop the BLE connection too early

## 1.3.0 (2026-07-22)

- Feature: (lboue) Dashboard adds a command panel for the ClosureControl cluster (Stop, Calibrate, MoveTo with position/latch/speed)
- Enhancement: (lboue) Dashboard node view shows the endpoint list as an indented parent/child tree
- Fix: (lboue) Detect camera Live View/Snapshot capabilities from the endpoint's clusters instead of hard-coding them by device type, so composed devices (e.g. Floodlight Camera) show the button only on the endpoint that actually supports streaming
- Fix: (lboue) Dashboard now re-negotiates the snapshot stream when the selected resolution, codec, frame rate, or watermark/OSD settings change, captures at the selected resolution even when reusing an existing stream, and serializes concurrent capture requests
- Fix: Update matter.js to the latest 0.17.7 alpha
    - Optimizations and fixes

## 1.2.8 (2026-07-20)

- Fix: WebRTC camera live view — `ProvideOffer` again selects the stream fields by the provider's cluster revision
- Fix: Ensures that updating Thread data from nodes in Thread visualization also updates the chart
- Fix: (lboue) Dashboard no longer offers live-view streaming controls for the Snapshot Camera device type, which doesn't support WebRTC — only Snapshot capture is offered
- Fix: Update matter.js to the latest 0.17.7 alpha
    - Optimizes Fallback address handling on connections
    - Ensures correct failsafe timer handling for long sleepy devices

## 1.2.7 (2026-07-16)

- Enhancement: Update matter.js to the latest 0.17.6 alpha
    - Optimizes OTA software updates
    - Prevents blocking on stop when a BLE discovery is still in progress

## 1.2.5 (2026-07-13)

- Enhancement: Update matter.js to 0.17.5

- Enhancement: Clarify Thread node role and unknown/external device descriptions in the network visualization (e.g. what a REED is, why a device shows as unknown/external) and link the OpenThread role primer

## 1.2.4 (2026-07-12)

- Enhancement: Update Docker base images to Debian trixie with the current Node 24 version
- Fix: Some more camera fixes in the dashboard
- Fix: Dashboard resets scroll position on navigation and focuses cluster command panels (ICD, ACL, Binding)

- Fix: Update WebRTC and Camera-related logic to respect available Pixelrate and Encoders of the camera device
- Fix: Optimize startup behavior

## 1.2.2 (2026-07-10)

- Fix: Ensure that WebSocket backpressure keeps the send-window full instead of draining one frame at a time, avoiding initial-sync stalls behind a high-latency proxy (e.g. Home Assistant ingress) that could drop the dashboard connection
- Fix: Optimize TBR address and data handling
- Fix: Update WebRTC and Camera-related logic and respect separate Audio/Video streams in Dashboard
- Fix: Update matter.js to the latest 0.17.5 nightly
    - Limit OTA/BDX block size to UDP max payload size

## 1.2.1 (2026-07-09)

- Fix: Optimize WebSocket backpressure calculation so a single large payload no longer trips congestion mode on a healthy client

## 1.2.0 (2026-07-09)

- Feature: Enhanced Thread Network diagnostics — collect and visualize per-Thread-network diagnostics also from Border Routers over MeshCoP (CoAP/DTLS) or the OTBR REST API (auto-selected, cached)
- Feature: Adds WiFi and Thread credential management and allows to store multiple entries. Commissioning can pick which stored network to use
- Feature: Adds ICD (Intermittently Connected Device) management including a "Power & Sleep (ICD)" dashboard panel. Requires devices with Matter 1.4+ for LIT management.
- Feature: Allows defining the default fabric label to use as CLI/ENV-option which then blocks changing via the WebSocket API
- Feature: Adds automatic time synchronization for devices that support it, pushing host time (UTC and time zone / DST). Enable it with the `--enable-time-sync` CLI option (env `ENABLE_TIME_SYNC`) when the host has a reliable, synced time source. Runs first 30-60 minutes after start, then every 24h.
- Enhancement: When one WebSocket connection defines a fabric label then other connections are blocked from changing that as long as the defining connection is still active
- Enhancement: Introduced WS schema 12 which supports the above features — see [WebSocket API schema changelog](docs/websocket-api-schema-changelog.md).
- Enhancement: New `--disable-thread-diagnostics` CLI flag (env `DISABLE_THREAD_DIAGNOSTICS`) turns off the entire Thread Border Router subsystem (discovery, probing, diagnostics) for plain Matter-controller deployments. Matter-over-Thread commissioning is unaffected
- Enhancement: WebSocket sends now apply per-connection backpressure — a slow or stalled client coalesces attribute/node updates and drops stale events instead of buffering without limit, preventing unbounded memory growth (OOM) under high event volume
- Enhancement: Update matter.js to the latest 0.17.5 nightly
    - Adds support for Matter 1.6.0
    - Adds support for ICD (SIT and LIT) devices
    - Fixes an invoke-issue where parallel multi-endpoint invokes were working but errors returned on WebSocket
    - Optimizes subscription reporting intervals
    - Ensures changed node structures are sent via WebSocket directly after re-subscribe and not delayed
- Adjustment: `webrtc_callback` events are now delivered only to the connection that issued the `send_webrtc_provider_command` for that camera session, instead of being broadcast to every connected client
- Fix: Ensures that the Python-Client does not crash anymore on unknown events from newer Server versions

    - Reduces data duplication in RAM in some places
    - Allows connections even for "at-the-edge-of-spec" devices with >1 hour of idle interval
    - Optimizes peer probing when mDNS addresses change
    - Hides GitHub rate limit errors when fetching certificates when some are already in storage

## 0.3.1 (2026-01-28)

- Adjustment: Adjust some logging messages

## 0.3.0 (2026-01-28)

- BREAKING: (Only relevant for users that do not use the HomeAssistant Add-On)
    - Now respects the provided FabricID and VendorID when starting the server and migrating data from a former storage!
      Before this version we always used the "first chip.json entry" and took FabricId/VendorId from there. Now the
      provided parameters are used, and if not matching to any chip.json entry, we startup with an empty storage.
    - Renames the storage directory from "server" to "server-<fabricId>-<vendorId>" to ensure proper separation of
      multiple servers in one storage
- Enhancement: Introduce /health endpoint to use for (docker) health checks. It returns the server version and number of nodes
- Enhancement: Correctly handles the start up of the server with multiple fabric-ids and vendor-ids in the same storage
- Adjustment: The server-id and storage directory inside the data directory will be renamed on next start to match the multi-fabric structure
- Adjustment: Adhere to the default nodeId 112233 for the controller itself as the Python Matter server did
- Adjustment: For fresh starts the next node id to be commissioned will be 1 as it was for the Python Matter Server
- Fix: Start up the server also when no nodes exist in the migrated json file. Logs a warning
- Fix: Tries to read the backup json-file when the normal json-file is not parseable or does not exist
- Fix: Optimize responsive layout of Dashboard
- Fix: Return errors more consistently to how the Python server was returning them
- Fix: Fixes datatypes for Neo Custom clusters to be decoded correctly
- Fix: Update matter.js to 0.16.8-nightly
    - Fixes many issues with reconnections to devices, especially when IPs change, e.g., in thread networks or such
    - Do not show updates that are available locally for unapplicable version ranges or already updated devices
    - Optimizes mDNS handling in general
    - Optimize re-using sessions pushed by devices instead of creating new ones

## 0.2.9 (2026-01-22)

- Fix: Fixes the datatype for the Eve pressure attribute
- Fix: Return mDNS-discovered IPs for a node when requesting them and also ping these
- Fix: Update matter.js to 0.16.7
    - Fix OTA update availability checks

## 0.2.8 (2026-01-22)

- Fix: Fixes the BLE commissioning capabilities

## 0.2.7 (2026-01-22)

- Enhancement: Optimizes initial migration with empty matter.js storage and inject peers directly
- Enhancement: Added an option to temporarily change the loglevel while the server runs
- Enhancement: Added Dark mode including selection of the theme via button and query parameter
- Enhancement: Streamlined the "No Websocket connection" page and allow reloading of the page
- Enhancement: Allow specifying timeouts for responses in the Websocket client and track them. Throws an error if the response times out
- Enhancement: Add the peer address in the dashboard after the node-id to allow mapping to logs more easily
- Adjustment: Optimize performance by migrating reading and invoking to use the new internal Node-API
- Fix: Refactor BigInt aware JSON parsing to avoid issues when importing nodes
- Fix: Show names in the dashboard in the same format as the Python server
- Fix: Fix some datatypes for custom eve cluster attributes
- Fix: Also respect the chip magic values when reading wildcard attributes
- Fix: Update matter.js to 0.16.6
    - Fixes and optimizations around mDNS discovery when starting the server the first time with many devices
    - Fixes some issues in high-traffic situations
    - Do not announce our node as update-provider to prevent issues if users switch back to the Python server
    - Correctly handle node decommissioning by other controllers and optimize decommissioning via ourselves
    - Extend error handling when persisting legacy node details
    - Optimize startup performance by initializing some internal structures lazy when needed
    - Logging enhancements

## 0.2.6 (2026-01-16)

- Enhancement: Show more details in the dashboard for software update states beside "Downloading"
- Fix: Initialize "next node id" correctly when starting the server
- Fix: Only execute custom attribute polling when the node is connected
- Fix: Streamlines Hex-Number displaying in the Dashboard (Cluster-/Attribute-IDs)

## 0.2.5 (2026-01-16)

- Enhancement: Uses a best effort approach to detect the used Fabric label from the Python server
- Fix: Ensures correct handling and storing of the desired FabricLabel

## 0.2.4 (2026-01-16)

- Enhancement: Re-adds the energy-polling for Eve devices that did not have an update to the Matter attributes
- Enhancement: Allows using Environment Variables to configure the Matter Server instead of using CLI parameters
- Enhancement: Displays the global cluster attributes always last in the cluster view of the dashboard
- Enhancement: Include custom cluster definitions in the generated dashboard data to show attributes and clusters with names
- Fix: Update matter.js to 0.16.5
    - Correctly handles already downloaded production OTA updates as production updates

## 0.2.3 (2026-01-15)

- Enhancement: Allows a LOG_LEVEL environment variable to control the log level of the Matter server when started via docker container
- Enhancement: Added some basic cluster commands (OnOff and LevelControl) to the dashboard for more simple testing.
- Fix: Prevents displaying of duplicate cluster details in the dashboard
- Fix: Update matter.js to 0.16.4
    - Also report attribute updates for bridges correctly (depending on endpoint-structure, they were partially missing)
    - Also accept invalid attribute-ids in the migrated and data from paired nodes
    - Exclude usage of the Thread interaction queue for command invokes, so you need to know yourself what you are doing

## 0.2.2 (2026-01-14)

- Fix: update matter.js to 0.16.2

## 0.2.1 (2026-01-13)

- Fix: remove a require-lookup which was not ESM

## 0.2.0 (2026-01-13)

- Initial release as Drop-In replacement for the [OHF Python-Matter-Server](https://github.com/matter-js/python-matter-server) v8.1.2. Please refer to the README.md for differences.
